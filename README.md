## Content

Each page is folder inside `./content`. Feel free to edit folder name and to add content to the `index.md` file.
Right now all the pages are in alphabetical order, but we could add `order` to each markdown file in the metadata section e.g.
```markdown
\---
thumbnail: ./image.jpg
order: 22
---

Text

```
